Hey ! I'm Seblor, a software and web fullstack developper hailing from France.

# IRL

{% assign dateStart = "1995-04-05" | date: '%s' %}
{% assign nowTimestamp = 'now' | date: '%s' %}

{% assign diffSeconds = nowTimestamp | minus: dateStart %}
{% assign diffDays = diffSeconds | divided_by: 3600 | divided_by: 24 | divided_by: 365 %}

I'm a {{ diffDays | round: 0 }} years old french guy living in Alsace. I've got a master's degree and mostly work with the JavaScript ecosystem (JS, TS, VueJS, Svelte, Node, Bun). I'm also agoraphobic and aphantasic, which is fine for a developper ðŸ˜‰

# On the Web

<script>
  var request=new XMLHttpRequest;request.open("GET","https://discordapp.com/api/v6/invites/mc-fr?with_counts=true",!0),request.onload=function(){if(this.status>=200&&this.status<400){var e=JSON.parse(this.response);document.getElementById("discord-members-count").innerHTML=e.approximate_member_count}},request.send();

I've been on the internet since 2005, so it's been quite some time. In 2013, I joined Minecraft-France as a forum moderator and became an administrator since 2016, which includes the Discord server created in 2015 (<span id="discord-members-count"></span> members).

I made most of the bots used for moderating the server, mainly a private multi-purpose bot, [Habrok](https://habrok.app) (a reputation bot), and [Plume](https://plume.red) (an activity logging bot)
